summary: Hi, my name is Ajithan Urutheran. I'm a junior software engineer that recently graduated from Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University) with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering with a specialization in Software Engineering. Some of my favourite courses include distributed cloud computing, fundamentals of data engineering, advanced data structures and algorithms, software testing and quality assurance and software project management, all of which helped broaden my knowledge of software development. I also have work experience as a full stack developer at RE/MAX where I developed web components and maintained websites using React.JS, Node.JS, Next.JS and MongoDB. In addition, I have worked as a researcher at Toronto Metropolitan University where I spearheaded the development of a geographic information system (GIS) web application using a myriad of geospatial research in MERN stack. I've always enjoyed the thrill of creating software applications and learning about finance. I started by creating simple excel scripts to help my friends with automating their tasks. This growing interest lead to developing web applications for different custom financial indicators. The rapid changes of the software industry allow me to feel at ease as there are always new technologies to explore and learn. I'm looking forward to leverage my experiences as a full-stack developer to join the FinTech industry as a backend/full-stack developer.

    description: Developed a Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring Agent App in order monitor resource usage across a cluster environment using Linux bash scripts, Git (version control), PostgreSQL (storing/querying usage data) and docker (containerizing database). The application will log the hardware specifications of the host connected to the node as well as the host's usage data. The usage data will be inserted into to a PSQL docker instance. Manually tested bash scripts by using dummy data and viewed data with select statements in SQL.
