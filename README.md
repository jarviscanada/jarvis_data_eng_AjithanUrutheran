# Ajithan Urutheran . Jarvis Consulting

Hi, my name is Ajithan Urutheran. I'm a junior software engineer that recently graduated from Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University) with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering with a specialization in Software Engineering. Some of my favourite courses include distributed cloud computing, fundamentals of data engineering, advanced data structures and algorithms, software testing and quality assurance and software project management, all of which helped broaden my knowledge of software development. I also have work experience as a full stack developer at RE/MAX where I developed web components and maintained websites using React.JS, Node.JS, Next.JS and MongoDB. In addition, I have worked as a researcher at Toronto Metropolitan University where I spearheaded the development of a geographic information system (GIS) web application using a myriad of geospatial research in MERN stack. I've always enjoyed the thrill of creating software applications and learning about finance. I started by creating simple excel scripts to help my friends with automating their tasks. This growing interest lead to developing web applications for different custom financial indicators. The rapid changes of the software industry allow me to feel at ease as there are always new technologies to explore and learn. I am seeking a developer position that allows me to delve into backend development or full stack development. I'm looking forward to leveraging my experiences as a full-stack developer to join the FinTech industry.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AjithanUrutheran](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AjithanUrutheran)


**Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AjithanUrutheran/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring Agent App in order monitor resource usage across a cluster environment using Linux bash scripts, Git (version control), PostgreSQL (storing/querying usage data) and docker (containerizing database). The application will log the hardware specifications of the host connected to the node as well as the host's usage data. The usage data will be inserted into to a PSQL docker instance. Manually tested bash scripts by using dummy data and viewed data with select statements in SQL.


## Highlighted Projects
**Variable Discounted Cashflow Calculator** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Aurutheran/DCF_Variable_Calculator)]: Created a Variable Discounted Cashflow Calculator web application that calculates the fair valuation of a stock and accounts for variable future changes rather than fixed amounts. Implemented the app with FastAPI, Vercel, Git, and HTML5/CSS3. Webscrapped financial documents from stockanalysis.com and utilized user inputs for growth percentages of EBITDA and free cash flow.

**AI Drone Gesture Controller** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Aurutheran/COE70_Capstone_LeapDrone)]: Developed a AI remote drone controller in Python in order to control a flight drone using your hand as an input. Implemented a gesture recognition convolutional neural network using tensorflow in order to classify and map hand gestures to drone controls. Transmitted drone control signals with a client-server connection. Created the application using Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV and pandas.

**Car Braking Embedded System**: Implemented a car braking embedded system on ARM Cortex M4 embedded processor in order to control the braking system of a car. Programmed the embedded system using C and Assembly in order to control the states of braking (Brake, Accelerate, Park, and ABS).

**Parking Garage System**: A parking garage system developed with Python, gRPC, and RabbitMQ in order to track capacity of the parking lot as well as available spots. Utilized gRPC in order to run methods remotely and to monitor health of the parking lot. Employed RabbitMQ to queue available parking spots and deliver estimated wait times to mobile devices through SMS.
