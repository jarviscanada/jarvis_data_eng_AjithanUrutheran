# Ajithan Urutheran . Jarvis Consulting

Hi, I'm a junior software engineer who graduated from Toronto Metropolitan University (formerly Ryerson University) with a Bachelor of Engineering in Computer Engineering with a specialization in Software Engineering. Some of my favorite courses include Distributed Cloud Computing, Fundamentals of Data Engineering, Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms, Software Testing and Quality Assurance, and Software Project Management, all of which helped broaden my knowledge of software development. I also have work experience as a full-stack developer at RE/MAX where I developed web components and maintained websites using React, Node, Next.JS, and MongoDB. In addition, I have worked as a researcher at Toronto Metropolitan University where I spearheaded the development of a geographic information system (GIS) web application using a myriad of geospatial research in the MERN stack. I've always enjoyed the thrill of creating software applications and learning about finance. I started by creating simple Excel scripts to help my friends with automating their tasks. This growing interest led to the development of web applications for different custom financial indicators. The rapid changes in the software industry allow me to feel at ease as there are always new technologies to explore and learn. I'm looking forward to leveraging my experiences as a full-stack developer to join the Fin-Tech industry as a backend/full-stack developer.

## Jarvis Projects

Project source code: [https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AjithanUrutheran](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AjithanUrutheran)


**Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AjithanUrutheran/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring Agent App in order monitor resource usage across a cluster environment using Linux bash scripts, Git (version control), PostgreSQL (storing/querying usage data) and docker (containerizing database). The application will log the hardware specifications of the host connected to the node as well as the host's usage data. The usage data will be inserted into a PSQL docker instance. Manually tested bash scripts by using dummy data and viewed data with select statements in SQL.

**Java Grep App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AjithanUrutheran/tree/master/core_java/grep)]: Implemented an application to search for files in a designated directory using a string input. The application behaves similarly to the Linux Grep command. The application was created using Java and StreamAPI. The application was dockerized to contain a fat jar file and dependencies. The first implementation was created using Lambda functions. The second implementation features a performance upgrade using StreamAPI to reduce the backlog of data flow. The application was manually tested using Intellij configurations and comparing outputs to expected values.

**Java Stock Quote App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AjithanUrutheran/tree/develop/core_java/jdbc)]: Created a Java stock quote application that mimics a real-time stock exchange. Data for the exchange is retrieved from Alpha Vantage API and stored in the Postgres database. The end-user has options to save, find, and delete stock information. In addition, they can purchase and sell positions in a stock. The project utilizes a service layer architecture containing entities, DAO, and a service layer. The application was developed in Java and uses a command line interface for functionality. The application was dockerized and uploaded on DockerHub. Unit testing was performed using JUnit across DAOs. Integration testing was performed using Mockito across different classes.

**Spring Boot Trading App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_AjithanUrutheran/tree/develop/springboot)]: Completed a Java trading application to improve Java stock quote app's monolithic structure. The application had a variety of features including purchasing, selling, and managing positions. Ease-of-use features such as a quote watchlist were included to help track and understand the performance of your quotes with minimal effort. Quote data was retrieved in real-time using Iex Cloud's stock API. The application was developed using core Java and Spring Boot. RestAPIs were leveraged for the application to mimic a microservice architecture and improve scalability. The project was managed using Maven with a database hosted on PostgreSQL for maintaining positions. The project was deployed on DockerHub with a container created to host application logic and another container for the database logic. Testing was performed on API end-points using Postman and verified on a mock database.

## Highlighted Projects
**Variable Discounted Cashflow Calculator** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Aurutheran/DCF_Variable_Calculator)]: Created a Variable Discounted Cashflow Calculator web application that calculates the fair valuation of a stock and accounts for variable future changes rather than fixed amounts. Implemented the app with FastAPI, Vercel, Git, and HTML5/CSS3. Webscrapped financial documents from stockanalysis.com and utilized user inputs for growth percentages of EBITDA and free cash flow.

**AI Drone Gesture Controller** [[GitHub](https://github.com/Aurutheran/COE70_Capstone_LeapDrone)]: Developed an AI remote drone controller in Python to control a flight drone using your hand as an input. Implemented a gesture recognition convolutional neural network using TensorFlow in order to classify hand gestures to drone controls. Transmitted drone control signals with a client-server connection. Created the application using Python, TensorFlow, OpenCV, and Pandas.

**Car Braking Embedded System**: Implemented a car braking embedded system on an ARM Cortex M4 embedded processor in order to control the braking system of a car. Programmed the embedded system using C and Assembly in order to control the states of braking (Brake, Accelerate, Park, and ABS).

**Parking Garage System**: A parking garage system developed with Python, gRPC, and RabbitMQ in order to track capacity of the parking lot as well as available spots. Utilized gRPC in order to run methods remotely and to monitor health of the parking lot. Employed RabbitMQ to queue available parking spots and deliver estimated wait times to mobile devices through SMS.
