Hello, here is some documentation on how the cron jobs work!

Make sure you are in the scripts directory.
cd /home/centos/Desktop/jarvis_data_eng_ajithan/linux_sql/scripts/


Once in here, I recommend you create a psql docker instance if you haven't already.
	bash psql_docker.sh create [username] [password]


If you have created a psql docker instance, you should start the psql service using docker
	bash psql_docker.sh start

Connect to your psql database using the following command and enter password:
	psql -h localhost -U postgres

	*Helpful Tip:
		You can run the sql/ddl.sql script to create tables


To check if the tables have been created you can connect to host_agent
	psql \c host_agent

We can use the following queries to check if the data exists.
	SELECT * from host_info;

	SELECT * from host_usage;



To manually add the host_info, we can run the host_info script along with the following arguements

	bash host_usage.sh localhost 5432 host_agent postgres password
	bash host_info.sh localhost 5432 host_agent postgres password (can only setup the machine once)

CRON
service crond stop (pauses cron)
service crond restart (starts the cron daemon)


To add a cron script you can...

bash> crontab - e

* * * * * bash /home/centos/Desktop/jarvis_data_eng_ajithan/linux_sql/scripts/host_usage.sh localhost 5432 host_agent postgres password > /tmp/host_usage.log
